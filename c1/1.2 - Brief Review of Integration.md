# 1.2 - Brief Review of Integration

## Definition of the Integral

Let $f : R \to R$ be an integrable function. $F(x)$ is the antiderivate of $f(x)$ if and only if $F'(x) = f(x)$.

$$ F(x) = \int f(x)dx \Longleftrightarrow F'(x) = f(x) $$

### Theorem 1.4 (Fundamental Theorem of Calculus)

Let $f(x)$ be a continuous function on the interval $[a, b]$, and let $F(x)$ be the antiderivative of $f(x)$. Then

$$ \int_{a}^{b} f(x)dx = F(x)|_{a}^{b} = F(b) - F(a) $$

### Theorem 1.5 (Integration by Parts)

Integration by parts is the counterpart for integration of the product rule.

Let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be continuous functions. Then

$$ \int f(x)g(x)dx = F(x)g(x) - \int F(x)g'(x)dx $$

where $F(x) = \int f(x)dx$ is the antiderivative of $f(x)$. For definite integrals

$$ \int_{a}^{b} f(x)g(x)dx = F(b)g(b) - F(a)g(a) - \int_{a}^{b} F(x)g'(x)dx $$

### Theorem 1.6 (Integration by Substitution)

Integration by substitution is the counterpart for integration of the chain rule.

Let $f(x)$ be an integrable function. Assume that $g(u)$ is an invertible and continuously differentiable function. The substitution $x = g(u)$ changes the integration variable from $x$ to $u$ as follows:

$$ \int f(x)dx = \int f(g(u))g'(u) du $$

For definite integrals

$$ \int_{a}^{b} f(x)dx = \int_{g^{-1}(a)}^{g^{-1}(b)} f(g(u))g'(u) du $$

**While we have counterparts for the product and chain rule, there is none for the quotient rule.**
