# 1.3 - Differentiating Definite Integrals

A definite integral of the form $\int_a^b f(x)dx$ is a real number. However, if a definite integral has functions as limits of integration;

$$ \int_{a(t)}^{b(t)}f(x)dx $$

or if the function to be integrated is a function of the integrating variable and of another variable;

$$ \int_a^b f(x,t)dx $$

then the result of the integration is a function (of the variable $t$ in the examples above). If certain conditions are met, this function is differentiable.

#### Lemma 1.2

Let $f : R \to R$ be a continuous function. Then,

$$ \frac{d}{dt}\left(\int_{a(t)}^{b(t)}f(x)dx\right) = f(b(t))b'(t) - f(a(t))a'(t) $$

where $a(t)$ and $b(t)$ are differentiable functions.

#### Lemma 1.3

Let $f : R \times R \to R$ be a continuous function such that the partial derivative $\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}$ exists and is continuous in both variables $x$ and $t$. Then,

$$ \frac{d}{dt}\left(\int_a^bf(x,t)dx\right) = \int_a^b\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}(x,t)dx $$

#### Lemma 1.4

Let $f(x,t)$ be a continuous function such that the partial derivative $\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}(x,t)$ exists and is continuous. Then,

$$ \frac{d}{dt}\left(\int_{a(t)}^{b(t)}f(x,t)dx\right) = \int_{a(t)}^{b(t)}\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}(x,t)dx + f(b(t),t)b'(t) - f(a(t),t)a'(t) $$

We note that [Lemma 1.2](#lemma-12) and [Lemma 1.3](#lemma-13) are special cases of [Lemma 1.4](#lemma-14).
